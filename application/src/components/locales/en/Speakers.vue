        <p>
            Dr. Roberto Martinez-Maldonado received the Ph.D. degree in Information Technologies from the University of
            Sydney in 2014. He is currently a Senior Lecturer of Learning Analytics and Human-Computer Interaction with the
            Faculty of Information Technology and Coordinator of the Centre for Learning Analytics with Monash University,
            Melbourne, VIC, Australia. He is a co-author of numerous research papers. He is the first Australian/Mexican to
            win the Swiss-based Jacobs Foundation Research Fellowship (2021–23) for his pioneering research in Human-Centred
            AI in Education. His research focuses on advancing the understanding of socio-technical issues around the use of
            artificial intelligence in education, promoting the use of human-centred methodologies to create learning
            analytics interfaces with integrity and enhancing authentic learning spaces with multimodal data-intensive
            computing capabilities. He has been Program Chair of the International Conference on Learning Analytics and
            Knowledge and the International Conference of Artificial Intelligence in Education, and he is a regular
            Associate Chair of the Learning and Education subcommittee of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in
            Computing Systems. He is Associate Editor of the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education.

        <p>
            Dr. Marisol Wong-Villacres is an Associate Professor at the Computer Science Program at the Escuela Superior
            Politécnica del Litoral in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 2021, she earned her PhD degree in Human-Centered Computing
            from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, United States, and in 2011, she earned a master's degree in
            Human-Computer Interaction at Indiana University, Bloomington. Marisol investigates how theories from the
            social, cultural, and learning sciences can inform strengths-based co-design of technologies with vulnerable
            groups such as immigrant families. Contrary to the traditional approach of designing for needs, which tries to
            correct the deficits of vulnerable populations, the strengths-based design that Marisol explores seeks to
            recognize, take advantage of, and enhance their knowledge and capabilities. Marisol has been a Fulbright scholar
            and a Schlumberger Faculty for the Future scholarship recipient. She is also a member of the Latin American
            Committee of the ACM SIGCHI, is a regular Associate Chair of the Critical Computing subcommittee for CHI, an
            associate editor for the ACM Journal on Computing and Sustainable Societies, Conference Chair of CLIHC 2023, and
            Paper Chair of CSCW 2024.

            Claudia López Moncada works as an academic in the Department of Computer Science at the Federico Santa María
            Technical University (UTFSM) in Valparaíso, Chile. She is also a researcher at the National Center for
            Artificial Intelligence (CENIA) and the Millennium Nucleus for Future of Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)
            in the same country. She earned her doctoral degree in Information Sciences and Technology from the University
            of Pittsburgh. Her work focuses on human-computer interaction (HCI) and person-centered artificial intelligence.
            Claudia is the co-director of the User Experience Laboratory at UTFSM and actively participates in the HCI
            community in Latin America and in initiatives to increase women's participation in computing.

            Dr. Philippe Palanque

        <p>
            Philippe Palanque is a professor in Computer Science at the University of Toulouse 3 and is the head of the
            department of Reliability of Software and Systems at IRIT (Toulouse Research Lab in Computing Sciences). For
            many years, he has been involved in research projects in the area of Command and Control Systems in multiple
            domains, including drones, multimodal interfaces for military cockpits, ground segment systems in satellite
            control rooms, Air Traffic Control workstations, Flight safety for launchpads, and more. In civil aviation, he
        worked on the specification and certification issues of new interactive cockpits (that have to be compliant with
        the ARINC 661 specification standard) of large airplanes such as the Airbus A350, with a recent focus on
        multi-touch interactions. In all these domains, the joint modeling of the interactive system behavior and user
        tasks was a key aspect to assess and ensure compatibility between operators’ work and the tools provided to them
        to perform this work. He has edited and co-edited more than twenty books or conference proceedings and
        co-authored more than 200 refereed publications in international conferences and journals. He is a member of ACM
        SIGCHI CHI Academy and chair of the IFIP Technical Assembly.
