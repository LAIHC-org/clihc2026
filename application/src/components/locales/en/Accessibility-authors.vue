        Accessible documents should be designed with perception and interaction alternatives in mind to
        ensure comprehension for all readers. If you use Microsoft Word, we recommend following <a
            class="uline"
            href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-word-documents-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-d9bf3683-87ac-47ea-b91a-78dcacb3c66d">the guide
            to making your document accessible</a>. Alternatively, Google Docs has published <a
            class="uline" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6199477?hl=en">tips on making
            your document or presentation more accessible</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        At a minimum, we suggest:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>The use of built-in heading styles</strong> to improve navigation: this
            helps people that use <a class="uline"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen readers</a> make
            an active reading.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The use of meaningful text for links:</strong> this improves navigation
            and readability; avoid “click here” links.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add alternative text to images:</strong> this helps people who use a
            screen reader to perceive visual content; it must be concise.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>In general, avoid tables if possible</strong>. But if you have to use it:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    <strong>Add alternative text and description to tables:</strong> it
                    helps people to use a screen reader to understand what is important in
                    the table; it must be specific and concise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use tables only for tabular information</strong>, not as
                    document structure. Also, you must configure the table header to appear
                    on subsequent pages.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>To add captions for figures and tables</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>To use simple language</strong>, as possible.
        </li>
    </ol>

        As minimum accessibility practices you can:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Give every slide a unique title.</strong> Make this using the built-in
            title box of the predefined slide templates.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add alternative text to images or mark them as decorative
                images:</strong> this helps people who use a screen reader to perceive
            visual content; it must be concise.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Highlight key elements</strong> on images: adding other marks besides
            color, helps people with color blindness.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Avoid the use of tables as possible.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>

    <p>
        If you need to publish a video, <strong>we suggest you generate closed
            captions</strong>: this could help people with hearing loss. <a class="uline"
            href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796?hl=en">You can create
            closed captions automatically on Youtube</a>,
        then edit them to <strong>use simpler language, as possible</strong>. Once you
        create your captions, you can download the <a class="uline"
            href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip">.SRT file</a> (“SubRip Subtitle” is one of
        the most common types of raw closed caption file formats or subtitle formats), and
        <a class="uline" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/261764017354370">use it to upload to
            the same
            video posted as a video from Facebook</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember it is important to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use closed captions</strong>: conciseness is recommended.</li>
        <li><strong>Use simple language</strong>, as possible.</li>
        <li>Identify the .SRT file for that particular video, for further use.</li>
    </ol>
